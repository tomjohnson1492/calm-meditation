# Readme

This is a simple Jekyll website with an MRSS feed that designed for creating an Amazon Fire TV app with [Amazon Creator](https://creator.amazon.com).

## Setup

Create posts in the \_posts folder following standard Jekyll post formats. Each post should have frontmatter and content similar to the sample posts.

This information, along with some values from the \_config.yml file, gets passed into the feed.xml file. You can view the feed.xml file here: http://idratherbewriting.com/calm-meditation/feed.xml.

This feed contains media properties that validate against the MRSS specification. Amazon Creator can consume this MRSS feed and create a Fire TV app.
